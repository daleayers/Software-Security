# Software-Security
Artemis Financial is a global financial institution that needs to update its security software. This is especially important for a financial institution that is dealing with sensitive information and ensuring their customer's trust. To access the vulnerability of the code, we examined it manually and then ran a dependency check. To refactor the code we created a checksum using SHA-256 algorithm cipher and changed from http to https. All of these projects allowed me to get a base understanding of how secure coding is understood and what major principles I should consider when working on a project.
